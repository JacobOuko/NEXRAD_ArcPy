<Description>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the metadata file for included a set of files and folders
of ABE 651 Final Project "Processing and Anlysis Steps".

* data are included 
  for "2005-07-26 00:00 to 2005-08-03 23:00" period

* Each step folder includes the program file 
  for radar rainfall processing. 


<Final Project files; program, input, and output file name or directory>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
step1_conversion (NEXRAD-XMRG format Conversion)
* program file name: xmrgtoasc.py
- input directory/file: XMRGFiles/xmrg_MMDDYYYY_HHz
- output directory/file: XMRGFiles/ascii_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc

<for "linux_ver">
* program file name: xmrgtoasc.LINUX.py, xmrgtoasc.CSHELL.csh
- input directory/file: XMRGFiles/xmrg_MMDDYYYY_HHz
- output directory/file: ASCIIFiles/ascii_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc
- linux command: csh xmrgtoasc.CSHELL.csh ./XMRGFiles ./ASCIIFiles ster


step2_georeferencing (Geo-referencing in ArcGIS)
* program file name: hraptoshg.py
- input directory/file: HRAPGrid/ascii_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc
- output directory/file: SHGGrid/shg_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc, shg_MMDDYYYY_HHz.prj

- output directory/file: output/xmrg_MMDDYYYY_HHz.dss


<File Descriptions>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1st Python script program for NEXRAD Conversion ##

- folder name: step1_conversion
- program file name: xmrgtoasc.py

>> for execution, need to subdirectory named "XMRGFiles",
   this folder must contain input files "xmrg_MMDDYYYY_HHz"
   which need to convert to ASCII file.
   then, type option (hrap or ster) when starting to run
   (ster must be selected for next step; geo-referencing)

>> The converted file will be in the same "XMRGFiles" folder.


* Linux ver. (included in program_conversion folder; linux_ver)
- program file name: xmrgtoasc.LINUX.py, xmrgtoasc.CSHELL.csh
- command for run

>> for execution, need to subdirectory named "XMRGFiles",
   this folder must contain input files "xmrg_MMDDYYYY_HHz"
   which need to convert to ASCII file.
   then, command: csh xmrgtoasc.CSHELL.csh ./XMRGFiles ./ASCIIFiles ster
   (3rd argument is option; hrap or ster)
   (ster must be selected for next step; geo-referencing)

>> The converted files will be in the "ASCIIFiles" folder.
   (output file name: ascii_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc)

** xmrg_MMDDYYYY_HHz: binary file (can't interpret)
** ascii_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc
: The data contains 5 (hrap) or 6 (ster) row of header information 
and number of ncols for columns and number of nrows for row 
space seperated radar data (nodata -9999.0, units: mm)


## 2nd Python script program for Georeferencing in ArcGIS ##

- folder name: step2_georeferencing
- program file name: hraptoshg.py

>> for execution, need to subdirectory named "HRAPGrid" and "SHGGrid",
   "HRAPGrid" folder must contain input files "ascii_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc"
   which is output of previous step and need to convert to SHGGird file.
   then, run hraptoshg.py program.
   (it takes quite a time, since multiple geoprocessing will be conducted)

>> The processed files will be in the same "SHGGrid" folder.
   (output file name: shg_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc)

** shg_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc
: The data contains 6 row of header information 
and number of ncols for columns and number of nrows for row 
space seperated radar data (nodata -9999, units: mm)


## 3rd program for DSS file generation ##

- folder name: step3_dss_generation
- program file name: asc2dssGrid.exe, asc2dssGrid.bat

>> for execution, need to subdirectory named "input" and "output",
   "input" folder must contain input files "shg_MMDDYYYY_HHz.asc"
   which is output of previous step and need to convert to DSS file.
   then, run asc2dssGrid.exe program with asc2dssGrid.bat.

>> The processed files will be in the same "output" folder.
   (output file name: xmrg_MMDDYYYY_HHz.dss)

** xmrg_MMDDYYYY_HHz.dss: binary file (can't interpret)
   <<This file can be used for HEC-DSS GirdUtil ver.2>>


Notice: All required programs and files must be in the working directory!
